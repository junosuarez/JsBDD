# JavaScript BDD package for Sublime Text 2

Adds autocompletions for BDD-style testing and assertions. Based on the syntax used by [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/), [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/), and [should](https://github.com/visionmedia/should.js).

### Usage

Install as a package for Sublime Text. `git clone` this repo into your ST user packages directory. On Windows, this is `%APPDATA%\Sublime Text 2\Packages`, eg `C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 2\Packages`.

This package adds a JavaScript (BDD test) language type to Sublime Text. By default, filenames matching *.test.js will use this syntax. To quick start a new test file, use the `newbdd` snippet.

Hit `ctrl+space` to see a list of the autocompletions available.

### Fine Print

Developed and tested on Sublime Text 2 beta build 2181. Your milelage may vary.
